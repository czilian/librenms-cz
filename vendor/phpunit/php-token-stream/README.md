To add this package as a local, per-project dependency to your project, simply add a dependency on `phpunit/php-token-stream` to your project's `composer.json` file. Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file that just defines a dependency on PHP_TokenStream:

        "require": {
            "phpunit/php-token-stream": "~1.2"
        }
    }
=======
You can add this library as a local, per-project dependency to your project using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

    composer require phpunit/php-token-stream

If you only need this library during development, for instance to run your project's test suite, then you should add it as a development-time dependency:

    composer require --dev phpunit/php-token-stream
